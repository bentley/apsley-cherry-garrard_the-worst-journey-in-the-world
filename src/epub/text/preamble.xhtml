			<p>This volume is a narrative of Scottâ€™s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Last Expedition</i> from its departure from England in 1910 to its return to New Zealand in 1913.</p>
			<p>It does not, however, include the story of subsidiary parties except where their adventures touch the history of the Main Party.</p>
			<p>It is hoped later to publish an appendix volume with an account of the two Geological Journeys, and such other information concerning the equipment of, and lessons learned by, this Expedition as may be of use to the future explorer.</p>
